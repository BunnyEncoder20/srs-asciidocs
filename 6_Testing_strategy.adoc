== Testing Strategy

The testing strategy ensures complete functional and non-functional validation of the IETM and LMS system, covering authoring, visualization, access control, content delivery, and LMS workflow performance.

=== Test Coverage (Validation Model)

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Test Type | Scope & Coverage

| **Unit Testing**
| * Validate XML parsing, schema compliance, and BREX rules.  
* Validate individual UI components (navigation, search bar, notes panel, CTMR file handling).  
* Test data loading, DM/PM rendering, and navigation structures.

| **Integration Testing**
| * Validate IETM and LMS module interaction.  
* Validate IETM S1000D dataset ingestion in viewer.  
* Test 2D/3D visualization pipeline and timeline synchronization.  
* Validate role-based access, authentication, and CTMR content operations.

| **System / End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
| * Full workflow testing: login → search → navigation → visualization → notes → LMS access.  
* Evaluate print, PDF export, watermarking, access restrictions, screenshot protection.  
* Complete testing of LMS workflows including training planning, scheduling, assignment, tracking, and reporting.

=== Non-Functional Testing (Performance, Security & Reliability)

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Test Type | Scope & Validation

| **Performance & Load Testing**
| * Simulate concurrent trainee and maintainer sessions.  
* Validate system response time for large XML and multimedia dataset loads.  
* Test scalability across training and operational environments.

| **Security & Vulnerability Testing**
| * Penetration testing using **OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Kali Linux**.  
* Validate protection against OWASP Top 10, CVE and CWE classifications.  
* Verify RBAC enforcement, encrypted credential storage, and offline access protection.  
* Validate watermarking and screenshot restriction measures.

| **Accessibility Testing**
| * WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility.  
* Screen reader compatibility (NVDA/JAWS), keyboard-only navigation and color contrast testing.

| **Usability Testing**
| * UI intuitiveness testing with representative end users (trainee, trainer, maintainer).  
* User feedback loop for navigation experience and productivity validation.

=== Testing Environments (Stage-Wise Validation Approach)

[cols="2,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Environment | Purpose | Notes

| **Development (DEV)**
| Component-level development testing.
| Local XML datasets, mock 2D/3D models, internal debugging.

| **QA / System Integration Testing**
| Validate system behavior across modules and roles.
| Simulated real-world scenarios, mock DB, search indexing, access control.

| **Staging**
| Pre-production configuration validation.
| Non-live server with full dataset, training simulation, load & security tests.

| **Production**
| Live deployment and continuous monitoring.
| Version-controlled rollout, rollback capability, log audit and performance metrics.

=== Implementation Strategy for Testing

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Area | Approach

| **Automation Strategy**
| Automate E2E UI flows using Selenium / Cypress / Playwright.  
Automate search indexing validation and role-based workflow testing.

| **Testing Tools**
| *Unit & Integration:* Jest, Mocha, Postman, Newman  
*E2E:* Cypress / Playwright  
*Load Testing:* JMeter / Locust  
*Security:* OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nessus  
*Accessibility:* AXE, WAVE

| **Defect Lifecycle & Tracking**
| Defect logging through Jira / Azure DevOps with severity classification and SLA tracking.

| **Release Quality Gates**
| Build promotion only after: Unit ≥ 90% coverage, all critical defects resolved, security compliance verified.
