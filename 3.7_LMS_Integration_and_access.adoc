| *Description*
a|
1. LMS accessible via icon/link embedded in the IETM console, co-hosted on the same server.  
2. Trainees access LMS via administrator-assigned credentials.  
3. Temporary credentials for program-specific access to training content.  
4. Deployment modes: **Full LMS** at training centers & **CTMR-only access** at operational units.  
5. Supports role-based dashboards and user-level content restrictions.

| *Architectural Design*
a|
1. **Front End Layer:**  
   * LMS icon/link integrated into IETM UI.  
   * Login page accessible for trainees and trainers.  
   * Role-based dashboard based on user profile.  

2. **Middleware Layer:**  
   * Authentication & session management.  
   * Access control based on deployment configuration.  
   * Credential issuance, renewal, and validation service.  

3. **Back End Layer:**  
   * PostgreSQL user database storing permanent & temporary credentials.  
   * CTMR repository with versioning and inheritance logic.  
   * Deployment configuration manager for environment-specific control.

| *Data Flow*
a|
1. User selects the **LMS icon/link** from the IETM console.  
2. Middleware validates credentials using authentication module.  
3. Authorization logic determines whether the user is routed to **Full LMS** or **CTMR-only** view.  
4. CTMR repository delivers content with version inheritance for operational deployment.

| *Implementation Methodology*
a|
* **Phase 1 – Integration Setup:** Embed LMS entry point within IETM console and enable co-hosted access.  
* **Phase 2 – Authentication & Credential Management:** Implement permanent and temporary credential workflows.  
* **Phase 3 – Deployment*
