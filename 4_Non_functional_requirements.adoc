[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Category | Requirements | Implementation Strategy

| **Performance**
| * UI screens shall load and render within 1–2 seconds for standard operations (navigation, open DM, open CTMR content).  
* Search operations (full-text / contextual) shall return results within 10–15 seconds for typical queries.  
* 2D/3D animations and multimedia playback shall run smoothly without noticeable lag on supported hardware.  
* System shall support concurrent access for multiple trainees, trainers, and maintainers across deployments.
| * Use efficient frontend rendering with React.js, virtual DOM, lazy loading, and code splitting for heavy views.  
* Optimize database queries and establish proper indexing for frequently accessed tables (DMs, CTMR, users, logs).  
* Use ElasticSearch (or equivalent) for search indexing and tune shards/replicas for query performance.  
* Cache static assets (images, models, scripts) and enable HTTP compression.  
* Conduct load testing and performance tuning for representative user loads and content volumes.

| **Reliability & Availability**
| * System shall operate fully offline at unit/ship level with no dependency on internet connectivity.  
* IETM and LMS services shall provide high availability (≥ 99% at training centers).  
* Critical services (auth, content delivery, CTMR, search) shall recover gracefully after restart or failure.
| * Deploy services in a containerized environment (Docker/Kubernetes) with health checks and restart policies.  
* Use local application and DB servers at each deployment site with backup & restore procedures.  
* Implement service-level monitoring (CPU, memory, response times) and alerting.  
* Schedule periodic backup of CSDB, CTMR, and user data; test restoration procedures regularly.

| **Scalability**
| * Support growing volume of manuals, training programs, and multimedia assets (2D/3D).  
* Scale horizontally to support additional training centers and operational units.  
* Search index, CTMR repository, and LMS modules must scale with increasing content and users.
| * Use modular microservice-style architecture for content, search, CTMR, LMS, and auth services.  
* Design database schema to support partitioning/sharding where necessary (per system/unit).  
* Use container orchestration (Kubernetes) to add replicas of stateless services as load increases.  
* Plan content archiving policies and separate hot/warm/cold data storage tiers.

| **Security**
| * Implement secure login with encrypted credential storage and role-based access control (RBAC).  
* Restrict content visibility, print/export rights, and LMS access based on roles and deployment mode.  
* Maintain audit logs for login, content access, print/export actions, and administrative operations.  
* Protect sensitive training and IETM content through watermarking and screenshot deterrence mechanisms.
| * Store passwords using strong one-way hashing (e.g., bcrypt/Argon2) and enforce password policies.  
* Implement RBAC at API and UI layer, mapping user roles to content categories and operations.  
* Use TLS/secure channels for all intra-network communications where applicable.  
* Implement centralized logging of security events and provide reporting views for security officers.  
* Add watermark overlays to sensitive pages and intercept known print/screenshot shortcuts where feasible.

| **Usability & Accessibility**
| * Provide ergonomic UI aligned with ISO/TR 9241-100 principles (clarity, low cognitive load, consistency).  
* Comply with WCAG 2.1 requirements: keyboard access, contrast, text scaling, screen-reader support.  
* UI should require minimal training for trainees, trainers, and maintainers.  
* Support personalization (theme, font size, layout preferences).
| * Establish UX design guidelines and reusable React component library following accessibility best practices.  
* Implement ARIA roles, focus management, skip-to-content links, and keyboard navigation for all key workflows.  
* Conduct usability tests with representative users (trainee, trainer, maintainer) and refine flows.  
* Implement user preferences storage in DB and apply them at login (theme, font, language).  
* Use clear visual hierarchy, breadcrumb navigation, and contextual help/tooltips.

| **Maintainability**
| * System components (IETM, LMS, CTMR, search, 3D viewer) shall be modular and loosely coupled.  
* Updates to content, UI, or backend services shall not require full system downtime.  
* Configuration for deployments (modes, roles, CTMR hierarchy) shall be centrally managed.  
* Search index, chatbot knowledge base, and training content shall be easy to update.
| * Use layered and modular architecture with well-defined service boundaries and APIs.  
* Implement CI/CD pipelines for safe rollouts, with rollback capability.  
* Externalize configuration (environment variables/config files) per environment (training center, unit).  
* Implement admin consoles for managing roles, content, and configuration.  
* Provide scripts/utilities for incremental re-indexing of search and updating chatbot content.

| **Portability**
| * CTMR packages shall be portable and deployable across unit/ship servers.  
* System shall support operation on a variety of hardware configurations (desktop, tablet, rugged handhelds).  
* LMS and IETM shall be deployable on different on-premise environments without major code changes.
| * Package CTMR and application services as Docker containers and/or portable deployment bundles.  
* Use standards-based technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JS, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL) to avoid vendor lock-in.  
* Provide deployment scripts and documentation for different on-prem infrastructures.  
* Support responsive design and adaptive layouts for different form factors.

| **Auditability**
| * All critical actions (login, logout, content access, print/export, admin changes, LMS assignments) shall be logged.  
* Audit history must support filtering and export for reporting and compliance checks.  
* Version history of CTMR and key content must be traceable.
| * Implement centralized audit logging service with structured log format (user, timestamp, action, object).  
* Store logs in dedicated tables with indexing for reporting; provide admin UI for search/export.  
* Integrate version control metadata into CTMR repository and IETM content operations.  
* Define log retention and archival policies as per customer security requirements.

| **Data Integrity & Consistency**
| * Ensure correctness of IETM DMs, CTMR content, training mappings, and LMS records.  
* Maintain versioning and parent-child inheritance for CTMR and training content updates.  
* Prevent partial or inconsistent updates during imports, publishing, or deployment sync.
| * Use database transactions for multi-step operations (imports, CTMR updates, assignments).  
* Implement validation rules at middleware level for content format, metadata, and references.  
* Apply referential integrity constraints in database schema.  
* Define and implement content lifecycle (draft, review, approved, published) with approvals.

| **Availability & Recovery**
| * System shall support restoration of operations following hardware/software failures with minimal data loss.  
* Local deployments at units/training centers should be able to recover from backup images.
| * Schedule regular database and repository backups; store in secure on-prem backup locations.  
* Test restoration and failover procedures periodically (DR drills).  
* Use redundant storage or RAID at server level where applicable.
