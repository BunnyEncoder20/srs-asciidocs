== 2.1 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

// Define the images directory (optional, but cleaner)
:imagesdir: assets

=== 2.1.1 Logical Architecture
The system follows a standard Multi-Tiered Architecture, ensuring separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, and data storage.

. **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**
* **Interface:** Fully browser-based interface compatible with standard Windows browsers.
* **Access Points:** Accessed via Thin Clients or Desktop workstations.

. **Application Layer (Middleware)**
* Acts as the central processing unit, handling:
** **Core Services:** Navigation, Search Engine, and Media Streaming.
** **Security:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Audit Logging.
** **Modules:** Chatbot assistance and IETM/LMS business logic.

. **Data Layer (Backend Repositories)**
* Persistent storage for critical system data:
** **S1000D Data Modules:** Technical documentation and XML content.
** **Operational Data:** CTMR (Computerized Technical Maintenance Record), User Notes, and Counters.
** **System Logs:** Audit trails and error logs.

=== 2.1.2 Deployment Architecture
The system is designed for secure, on-premises deployment within air-gapped PGAD networks.

* **Server Infrastructure:**
** **Main Server:** Hosts the central IETM/LMS application and master database.
** **Training Center Server:** Dedicated instance for LMS training modules.
* **Edge Nodes:**
** **Unit CTMR Nodes:** Localized nodes for maintenance record synchronization.
* **Offline Capabilities:**
** Supports generation of offline IETM Level 3 export packages for field usage.
