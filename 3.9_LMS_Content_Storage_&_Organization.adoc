| *Description*
a|
1. Store curated and prepared training material inside **CTMR** under trainer credentials.  
2. Organize content modularly by **system/subsystem**, with controlled access.  
3. Enable admin governance for modifying or deleting training materials stored in repository.

| *Architectural Design*
a|
1. **Front End Layer:**  
   * Repository browser providing folder hierarchy navigation.  
   * Upload, organize, and manage training content modules.  
   * Role-based visibility for trainers and admins.  

2. **Middleware Layer:**  
   * Business logic for content indexing, access enforcement, and versioning.  
   * Modular classification engine for system/subsystem tagging.  
   * Governance functions (delete/modify/audit) for authorized admin roles.  

3. **Back End Layer:**  
   * CTMR repository for structured storage of curated materials.  
   * Metadata indexer database tracking ownership and classification.  
   * Audit logger for event tracking (changes, deletions, access activity).

| *Data Flow*
a|
1. Trainer uploads curated training content to CTMR via repository manager UI.  
2. Middleware validates file, assigns metadata, and applies system/subsystem tags.  
3. CTMR stores content with version indexing and access permissions.  
4. Role-based view allows controlled access; admin may modify or delete entries via governance console.

| *Implementation Methodology*
a|
* **Phase 1 – CTMR Repository Setup:** Implement structured storage model and metadata schema.  
* **Phase 2 – Repository UI:** Develop file manager–style interface with upload and hierarchy features.  
* **Phase 3 – Access Control:** Apply RBAC-based visibility and edit/delete permissions.  
* **Phase 4 – Modular Tagging:** Add system/subsystem classification and search indexing.  
* **Phase 5 – Audit & Governance:** Enable version tracking, change logs, and admin controls.
