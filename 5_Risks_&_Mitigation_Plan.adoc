== Risks & Mitigation Plan

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk Category | Potential Risk | Mitigation Strategy

| **Technical Risks**
| Performance degradation due to large multimedia assets (3D models, animations, CTMR content).
| * Use CDN-style caching for large files and optimize rendering pipelines.  
* Compress 3D assets and apply lazy loading and model streaming.  
* Conduct load tests and scale services using Kubernetes replicas.

| Search engine performance degradation with large content volumes.
| * ElasticSearch tuning (index sharding, analyzer selection, caching).  
* Implement throttling and background indexing for large imports.

| Integration complexity between IETM ↔ LMS and third-party content.
| * Use modular APIs with version control and interface contract validation.  
* Conduct early integration testing with sample datasets.

| Offline operating limitations at deployment sites.
| * Ensure complete offline database and services replication.  
* Provide fallback sync mechanism using secure portable media.

| **Security Risks**
| Unauthorized access or misuse of confidential manuals or training content.
| * Enforce RBAC, encrypted credential storage, and watermarking.  
* Enable audit logging and anomaly tracking.

| Data losses due to incorrect updates, accidents, or corruption.
| * Implement backup strategy and restore testing schedule.  
* Enforce transactional updates and role-based publishing workflow.

| Malware or external security threats when accessing intranet sources.
| * Enable file validation & antivirus scanning for uploaded/imported files.  
* Enforce HTTPS/TLS communication within secured networks.

| **Operational Risks**
| Insufficient training leading to poor adoption by users.
| * Provide onboarding walkthroughs, user manuals, help videos, and tooltips.  
* Conduct periodic training and user feedback workshops.

| Multiple deployment environments increasing configuration complexity.
| * Use environment-based configuration profiles.  
* Maintain configuration manager in middleware for deployment modes.

| Human error during repository updates or content governance.
| * Implement approval workflow and confirmation prompts for modify/delete.  
* Maintain version history and change rollback capability.

| **Infrastructure Risks**
| Hardware failure at unit-level deployments affecting availability.
| * Maintain local backups and redundant deployments.  
* Provide minimum hardware configuration guidelines and DR procedures.

| Network instability affecting sync to operational units.
| * Use asynchronous data sync with checksum validation.  
* Design portable CTMR packages for offline transport.

| **Compliance Risks**
| Non-compliance with S1000D, WCAG 2.1, ISO/TR 9241 standards.
| * Perform periodic internal compliance audits.  
* Run accessibility and standards validation tools.  
* Conduct design reviews and keep documentation traceability.

| Legal or audit issues due to missing access logs.
| * Maintain structured audit logging with export functionality.  
* Define retention policy and reporting support.
