| *Description*
a|
1. UI shall conform to **ISO/TR 9241-100 ergonomic guidance**.
2. Implement rich UX with graphics, interactivity, and intuitive navigation.
3. Provide comprehensive navigation set (menus, search, breadcrumbs).
4. Enable **screen printing, PDF export, and watermarking**.
5. Disable **screenshot** functionality in the software.
6. Support keyboard/touch navigation and accessibility features.

| *Architectural Design*
a|
The User Interface is built using a component-driven architecture with accessibility-first design.

1. **Front-End Layer:** React.js UI components, responsive design, ergonomic layout.
2. **Accessibility Layer:** ARIA roles, focus indicators, high-contrast themes, scalable fonts.
3. **Interaction Services:** Navigation system, multimedia viewer, print/export & watermarking engine.
4. **Security & UX Control:** Screenshot restriction via event hooks and watermark overlays.
5. **Backend Integration:** REST APIs for content, search, permissions, and export processing.

| *Data Flow*
a|
1. User performs an action (navigation / view / settings update).
2. React component updates application state and interacts with backend APIs as required.
3. Backend returns data (DM content, search results, export PDF file).
4. UI applies ergonomic & accessibility settings before rendering to user.
5. For PDF export → UI sends request → backend generates PDF with watermark → returns file → print/download.

| *Implementation Methodology*
a|
* **Design Phase:** Build ergonomic prototypes aligned to ISO/TR 9241-100; validate navigation flow.
* **Development Phase:** Develop reusable React components, accessibility controls, and export services.
* **Integration Phase:** Connect UI modules with backend APIs (content, search, print/export).
* **Security Phase:** Implement screenshot restrictions and dynamic watermarking.
* **Testing Phase:** Perform usability testing, accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1), and cross-device verification.
