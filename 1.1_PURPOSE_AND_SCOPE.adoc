==  PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1. This Software Design Specification Document provides a comprehensive, build-ready
   design for two systems: an air-gapped, on-premises Interactive Electronic Technical
   Manual (IETM) Level 4 system, and a co-hosted Learning Management System (LMS).

2. The design ensures full compliance with all requirements outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and the Request for Proposal (RFP).

3. It aligns with key international standards:
   * S1000D version 4.2 for structured technical documentation
   * ASD-STE-100 for simplified technical English
   * ISO/TR 9241-100 for ergonomic design principles

4. Additionally, the design supports milestone-based acceptance and delivery, ensuring
   that progress can be tracked and validated at defined stages.
